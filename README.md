# PacManGame
My version of the classic PacMan game
You can run the with just tkinter and random installed. 

My thoughts on the project

The code

My code is a mess. There are diffrent variables everywhere and most of them could be avoided if I was planing my code better. I am proud that the code is working and that the game is playable. For now there is no score and speed multiplaier and thus all rounds are the same. Also the AI (The ghosts) are not to optimized but they are getting the job done. I will introduce the score and speed mulipier and also make the ghosts AI better when i find a good solution. My main focus for now is to clean up and make the code more readable for other programmers. 

What i learned for the project

I need to write more readable code
My code works. But its hard for other developers or even my self sometimes to imporve and edit the code. From this project i have learned that variable names need to explain what the variable thus so its easy to understand. I need to name my funtions better and also use comments sometimes to make the code more readable and understandable.




I need to plan my code better

My solutions are creative and work. But they use way to many variable and the lack of planing forced me to introduce way to many variables just to get a line of code working. My next project i will plan it out much better and thus i will reduce the amout och code, variables and funtions and this will my program faster and more efficent.
